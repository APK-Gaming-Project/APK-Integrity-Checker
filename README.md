# APK Integrity Checker

## Overview

The **APK Integrity Checker** is a tool designed to verify the authenticity and integrity of APK files. By validating APK signatures and performing hash comparisons, this tool ensures that APK files have not been tampered with after modification. This repository provides the necessary scripts and resources to help developers and users verify the safety of their APKs.

## Key Features

- **Signature Verification**: Ensures that APK signatures are valid and have not been altered.
- **Hash Comparison**: Compares the original APK hash with the current version to detect unauthorized changes.
- **Detailed Reports**: Provides easy-to-understand reports on the integrity status of APK files.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Quickly verify APK integrity directly from your terminal.
- **Automated Workflow**: Integrate APK signature verification into your development pipeline for continuous monitoring.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use the APK Integrity Checker, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- The following Python packages: `hashlib`, `subprocess`, `os`

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/apk-integrity-checker.git
   cd apk-integrity-checker
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

#### 1. **Signature Verification**
To verify the signature of an APK file:
```bash
python verify_signature.py /path/to/your/apkfile.apk
```

This script will check the APK’s signature and ensure it matches the original.

#### 2. **Hash Comparison**
To compare the APK’s current hash with an expected hash:
```bash
python compare_hash.py /path/to/your/apkfile.apk <expected-hash>
```

This will ensure the file has not been altered from its original state.

### Example Output

```bash
File: your-apkfile.apk
Signature Valid: Yes
Hash Match: Yes
Integrity: Unmodified
```
